# Simple Company CRUD
### Python, Django, Faker, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML

Django 2.0.2 and Python 3.6.5 were used.  Bootstrap 4.1.0 was used for styling.

A list of companies with associated information and employees was generated using Python's faker 0.8.13 library.  A Python file named "populating.py" can be run to populate the Company and Employee data models.

On the "Companies" page, each company can be clicked on.  On individual company pages, the company can be updated or deleted.  New companies can also be created using a form on the "Create" page.
